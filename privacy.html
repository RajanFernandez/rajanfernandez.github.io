    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <p>Privacy policies can be very complicated so I've chosen to keep this one simple. The statements below apply to all the apps I currently have in the App Store. If you have any concerns around the privacy of your data in any of the apps I've published, please get it touch and I'll be happy to provide clarification.</p>
    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
    <p>Your location data is used if you have allowed the app to do so. This data is used to show your location on the map (NZ Topo Maps and MotoParks), and let's you save your current location as a waypoint (NZ Topo Maps). As with all iOS apps, you can prevent the app obtaining access to your location data by adjusting access in the Settings app.</p>
    <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
    Your location data is only used to show your location on the map (NZ Topo Maps and MotoParks) and to let you save your current location as a waypoints (NZ Topo Maps). It does not leave your device unless you chose to export and share waypoints that you have recorded. 
    <h2>Do we share your information to outside parties?</h2>
    <p>None or your data is shared with any third party.</p>
    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>No third party analytics are used in any of the apps I have published.</p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any concerns around the privacy of your data in any of the apps I've published, please get it touch with me through LinkedIn and I'll be happy to provide clarification.</p>
    <h2>Privacy Policy updates</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may change at any time to ensure it is current as apps are updated.</p>
